Gradle commands:

.\gradlew
-> build : compile source code into a distributable format (like .jar file)
-> run   : execute application from grade project, will build if necessary,
-> clean : removes the build, allowing you to rebuild if you wish (good for if there are strange errors)
-> test  : runs all tests

Project State:
I am currently setting this up to be a polyglot project using Java, Kotlin, Clojure
I may add more later idk
Right now it seems I set it up correctly to connect everything across the different gradle builds and different environments

Immediate next step:
It seems I may have syntax errors or incorrect kotlin environment. I should fix this, try to run the project and see if the UI is working as it did before.
Once I confirm that the UI is working, I can move onto actual functionality.

Far next steps:
Allow connection to run times, handle errors gracefully, add a REPL/Compile button
Allow for REPL/Compile button to switch between running code line by line or executing the whole file. Find better name then compile
Try to set up HTTPS history and websocket monitoring feature.
Figure out how a UI display would work, I'll likely need a mini browser launch to allow for this and HTTP history feature
Maybe add a feature to view the database and stuff about it? Like history of interaction with DB? Similar to the monitoring services for all the other things but for DB as well

Plan out some more. This will be cool, and allow for a nice dev experience in which one can see all the components and how they are interactively.
